# Modes

## Available modes

| Mode | Activation | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Light | Default (no `.dark` class) | **Default** — standard light appearance |
| Dark | `.dark` class on `<html>` | Dark appearance, user preference |

Astra supports two modes. All semantic tokens automatically adapt between them.

## How to set mode

### Via ThemeProvider (recommended)

Wrap your app root with `ThemeProvider` — it handles mode switching, persistence, and system preference detection automatically.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@figma/astraui'

<ThemeProvider>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

`ThemeProvider` reads `localStorage('astra-theme')` on mount and falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`. It adds/removes the `.dark` class on `<html>`.

### Via useTheme hook

Toggle or set the mode from any child component:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@figma/astraui'

function ThemeToggle() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme, setTheme } = useTheme()
  return <Button onClick={toggleTheme}>{theme}</Button>
}
```

### Manual (without ThemeProvider)

Set the `.dark` class on `<html>` — not `<body>`:

```tsx
// Correct
document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')

// Wrong — tokens won't apply
document.body.classList.add('dark')
```

## Token behavior across modes

All semantic tokens flip automatically. Examples:

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `--brand-tertiary` | `#EBF0FF` (light blue) | `#1a1f2e` (dark navy) |
| `--surface-bg` | `#ffffff` | `#161621` |
| `--text-primary` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.85)` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` |
| `--border-primary` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.15)` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.15)` |

Some tokens stay constant across both modes:

| Token | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `--brand-primary` | `#2E62FF` | Brand identity is consistent across modes |
| `--on-brand` | `#ffffff` | Always white on brand surfaces |
| `--on-reverse` | `#1e1e1e` | Always dark — for elements that must contrast in both modes |
| `--modal-scrim` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.75)` | Backdrop is always dark |

## Components that need extra attention

Some components appear on surfaces that don't change with mode, or overlay media content. These must work on both light and dark backgrounds regardless of the current mode:

- **FavoriteButton** — overlays video thumbnails, uses `surface-bg` background that adapts
- **DurationBadge** — overlays video thumbnails, uses `input-bg` background with white text
- **Tooltip** — uses `surface-dark` background with `on-brand` text in both modes

## Rules

- Always use semantic tokens — never hardcode hex values for colors that should adapt
- If you use tokens correctly, dark mode support comes for free
- Test both modes — especially for custom layouts and compositions
- `on-brand` is always white in both modes — use it for text on `brand-primary` or dark surfaces
- `on-reverse` is always dark in both modes — use it for elements that must stay dark
- `text-tertiary` has low contrast in both modes — never use it for critical content
- `ThemeProvider` must be an ancestor of any component calling `useTheme()`
